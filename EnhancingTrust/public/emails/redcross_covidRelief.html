<p class="text-paragraph">During the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, life’s emergencies don’t stop — and neither does the work of the 
American Red Cross.</p>

<p class="text-paragraph">Because everyone’s wellbeing is our top priority, we continue to work closely with public health officials to deliver our services safely and coordinate our efforts with government agencies and partners. This means that, as the coronavirus evolves and affects communities differently, 
our services may look different in each area to ensure we are aiding local families where they need us most.</p>
