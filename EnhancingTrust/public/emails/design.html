  <p>Dear John:</p>

  <p>We’d like to remind you to review your Social Security Statement online. The Statement has important Social
    Security information and, if applicable, estimates of your future benefits.</p>

  <p>If you are working, we encourage you to check your Statement yearly to make sure your earnings record is correct.
    The Statement also will help in planning your financial future.</p>

  <p>To view your most recent Statement, please visit <a href="#">www.socialsecurity.gov/reviewyourstatement</a> and
    sign in to your account.</p>

  <p>On June 10, 2017, we added a second method to verify your identity each time you sign in to your account. This is
    in addition to your username and password. Using two ways to identify you when you log on will help better protect
    your account from unauthorized use and fraud. Now, when you sign in to your account you will complete two steps:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Step 1: <span data-tooltip="Sensitive information requested">Enter your username and password.</span></li>
    <li>Step 2: Enter the security code we send you by text message or email, depending on your choice (your cell phone
      provider’s text message and data rates may apply).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>With instant access to your Social Security Statement at any time, you will no longer receive one periodically in
    the mail, saving money and the environment. Thank you for Going Green!</p>

  <p>Please do not reply to this email, as we are unable to respond to messages sent to this address.</p>
